# :page_with_curl: Description
* A memory game.
* The application keeps track of the user's score. 
* Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order. 
* The user's score gets incremented when clicking an image for the first time.
* The user's score get reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.
* Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
* Images are pulled over from `GIPHY API`
