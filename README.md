# :page_with_curl: Description
* A web app memory game that keeps track of the user's selected images and updates their scores accordingly. 
* Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order. 
* The user's score gets incremented when clicking on an image for the first time.
* The user's score gets reset to 0 if they click on the same image for the second time.
* Once the user's score has reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts.
* Images are NOT pulled over from a file or database, but they are dynamic data fetched from `GIPHY API`
